# SONYC Legacy System

## Introduction
Noise pollution is an increasing threat to the well-being and public health of city inhabitants. It has been estimated that around 90% of New York City (NYC) residents are exposed to noise levels exceeding the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) guidelines on levels considered harmful to people. The complexity of sound propagation in urban settings and the lack of an accurate representation of the distribution of the sources of this noise have led to an insufficient understanding of the urban sound environment. While a number of past studies have focused on specific contexts and effects of urban noise , no comprehensive city-wide study has been undertaken that can provide a validated model for studying urban sound in order to develop long-lasting interventions at the operational or policy level.

In 2017, the NYC 311 information/complaints line received 447,090 complaints about noise, up 6.3% from 2016. NYC has tried to regulate sources of noise since the 1930s and in 1972 it became the first city in the U.S. to enact a noise code. As a result of significant public pressure, a revised noise code went into effect in 2007. This award-winning code, containing 84 enforceable noise violations, is widely-considered to be an example for other cities to follow. However, NYC lacks the resources to effectively and systematically monitor noise pollution, enforce its mitigation and validate the effectiveness of such action. Generally, the Noise Code is complaint driven. The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) inspectors are dispatched to the location of the complaint to determine the ambient sound level and the amount of sound above the ambient, where a notice of violation is issued whenever needed. Unfortunately, the combination of limited human resources, the transient nature of sound, and the relative low priority of noise complaints causes slow or in-existent responses that result in frustration and disengagement. The extent of the noise problem in NYC, its population, and ever-changing urban soundscape provides an ideal venue for the long term monitoring and ultimately, an enhanced understanding of urban sound.

## Sounds Of New York City Project
At the Sounds Of New York City or SONYC project, we have deployed a network of over 50 low-cost acoustic sensor nodes across NYC to facilitate the continuous, real-time, accurate and source-specific monitoring of urban noise . Some of these nodes have been operational since May of 2016, resulting in the accumulation of vast amounts of calibrated sound pressure level (SPL) data and it’s associated metrics. Cumulatively to date, 52 years of SPL and 26 years of raw audio data has been collected from the sensor network. This data can be used to identify longitudinal patterns of noise pollution across urban settings . Using the inferences from this data, decision makers at city agencies can strategically utilize the human resources at their disposal, i.e. by effectively deploying costly noise inspectors to offending locations automatically identified by the network. The continuous and long term monitoring of noise patterns allows for the validation of the effect of this mitigating action in both time and space, information that can be used to understand and maximize the impact of future action. By systematically monitoring interventions, one can understand how often penalties need to be imparted before the effect becomes long-term. With sufficient deployment time, 311 noise complaint patterns can also be compared to the network’s data stream in a bid to model and ultimately predict the occurrence of noise complaints. The overarching goal would be to understand how to minimize the cost of interventions while maximizing noise mitigation. This is a classic resource allocation problem that motivates much research on smart-cities initiatives, including this one.
