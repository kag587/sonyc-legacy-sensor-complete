## Introduction
Noise pollution is an increasing threat to the well-being and public health of city inhabitants . It has been estimated that around 90 % of New York City (NYC) residents are exposed to noise levels exceeding the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) guidelines on levels considered harmful to people . The complexity of sound propagation in urban settings and the lack of an accurate representation of the distribution of the sources of this noise have led to an insufficient understanding of the urban sound environment. While a number of past studies have focused on specific contexts and effects of urban noise , no comprehensive city-wide study has been undertaken that can provide a validated model for studying urban sound in order to develop long-lasting interventions at the operational or policy level.

In 2017, the NYC 311 information/complaints line received 447,090 complaints about noise, up 6.3 % from 2016. NYC has tried to regulate sources of noise since the 1930s and in 1972 it became the first city in the U.S. to enact a noise code . As a result of significant public pressure, a revised noise code went into effect in 2007 . This award-winning code, containing 84 enforceable noise violations, is widely-considered to be an example for other cities to follow . However, NYC lacks the resources to effectively and systematically monitor noise pollution, enforce its mitigation and validate the effectiveness of such action. Generally, the Noise Code is complaint driven. The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) inspectors are dispatched to the location of the complaint to determine the ambient sound level and the amount of sound above the ambient, where a notice of violation is issued whenever needed. Unfortunately, the combination of limited human resources, the transient nature of sound, and the relative low priority of noise complaints causes slow or in-existent responses that result in frustration and disengagement. The extent of the noise problem in NYC, its population, and ever-changing urban soundscape provides an ideal venue for the long term monitoring and ultimately, an enhanced understanding of urban sound.

## Sounds Of New York City Project
At the Sounds Of New York City or SONYC project, we have deployed a network of over 50 low-cost acoustic sensor nodes across NYC to facilitate the continuous, real-time, accurate and source-specific monitoring of urban noise . Some of these nodes have been operational since May of 2016, resulting in the accumulation of vast amounts of calibrated sound pressure level (SPL) data and it’s associated metrics. Cumulatively to date, 52 years of SPL and 26 years of raw audio data has been collected from the sensor network. This data can be used to identify longitudinal patterns of noise pollution across urban settings . Using the inferences from this data, decision makers at city agencies can strategically utilize the human resources at their disposal, i.e. by effectively deploying costly noise inspectors to offending locations automatically identified by the network. The continuous and long term monitoring of noise patterns allows for the validation of the effect of this mitigating action in both time and space, information that can be used to understand and maximize the impact of future action. By systematically monitoring interventions, one can understand how often penalties need to be imparted before the effect becomes long-term. With sufficient deployment time, 311 noise complaint patterns can also be compared to the network’s data stream in a bid to model and ultimately predict the occurrence of noise complaints. The overarching goal would be to understand how to minimize the cost of interventions while maximizing noise mitigation. This is a classic resource allocation problem that motivates much research on smart-cities initiatives, including this one.

## Remote sensing
Remote sensor networks have been a focus of research for at least 60 years. The majority of recent research focuses on the performance characteristics of networks with respect to their networking strategies or power consumption, as the majority of examples are battery reliant . Remote acoustic sensor networks allow for the collection of longitudinal acoustic data from a collection of static locations. The abilities of these networks are often dictated by their price points. High–cost commercially available static noise monitoring solutions such as Bruel and Kjaer’s (B&K) Noise Sentinel system , provide highly accurate SPL measurements, wireless data transmission and a web portal for real–time data visualization. These have been used for the long-term monitoring and reduction of air traffic noise around NYC airports with a deployment of 32 noise monitoring stations . The cost of these networks limit their scalability and deployability, with each sensor costing upwards of $15,000 USD. Typically these networks are rented to a client at the cost of $105 USD per day. At these prices, a modestly sized network of 32 sensor locations as previously mentioned would result in an annual cost of around $1.23 Million USD. However, at these prices, B&K does offer a guarantee of greater then 95% uptime of the sensor network with dedicated support. These networks are used to ensure that major airports are in compliance with local air noise codes.

New York City noise has been the focus of a plethora of studies investigating: noise levels in relation to air pollutants and traffic , noise exposure from urban transit systems and noise exposure at street level . All of these highlight the fact that noise is an underrepresented field in urban health and found that average levels of outdoor noise at many locations around the city exceed federal and international guidelines set to protect public health. Sensing of noise conditions using 56 relatively low cost logging sound level meters (SLMs) was investigated in , where general purpose SLMs were used to log SPL measurements over the period of one week. These type of deployments can help to identify noise patterns over short periods of time with respect to other factors such as traffic intensity, but are lacking in their ability to monitor noise over longer duration’s. Long term noise monitoring is required to allow health researchers to perform better epidemiological studies of environmental contributions to cardiovascular disease .

The recent surge in the development of consumer mobile devices, namely smart-phones has resulted in rapid improvements in processing power, storage capacity, embedded sensors, and network data rates. The idea behind the use of consumer devices in mobile remote sensing is to utilize the sensing, processing and communication capabilities of consumer smart-phones to enable members of the public to collect and upload environmental data from their surroundings. This approach benefits from the use of existing infrastructure (sensing platform and cellular networks) meaning that deployment costs are effectively zero, provides unrivaled spatial coverage and also allows for the gathering of the subjective response to these environments, in-situ. The drawbacks of this approach mainly lie in the low temporal resolution of its data resulting from the submission of short term measurements and the quality of the gathered noise data, as the model, physical and handling conditions of the smart-phones may not be consistent, resulting in aggregated environmental data of variable accuracy. A number of initiatives have sought to crowdsource sound and noise monitoring using mobile devices . Their apps are typically limited to logging geo-located instantaneous sound pressure level measurements.

A Spanish team describe their example of a mobile acoustic sensor network in a 2016 paper . Their aim was to facilitate the creation of real-time urban noise maps using bus mounted noise sensors. These sensors would be battery operated and transmit bandwidth heavy noise data via Wi-Fi and lighter remote control data via a 2G cellular connection. This ambitious project faced many challenges, not least the issue of differentiating between the noise of the bus each sensor was mounted to and the surrounding noise of interest. Their communications challenges were also unique as they were relying on opportunistic connectivity from free and open Wi-Fi networks that the bus would pass through during the run of its route. This presents a number of challenges when designing for maximal data yield and network resilience.

The majority of sensor network studies in the literature are rather short in length and low in scale. An example of a longer duration study focused on noise came from Piper in 2017 . This highly relevant study focuses on the data collection from a network of 16 low-cost noise monitoring stations based around a Raspberry Pi 2B single board computer. One minute resolution noise data was collected across a six month period at a construction site in London. The availability or uptime of the sensor network is discussed with favorable values of 67.6% to 97.8%. Power failures and adverse weather conditions were seen to have an effect on uptime. The study was also able to generate some useful inference on the noise conditions of the localized site, proving the efficacy of longitudinal noise sensor network deployments for the understanding of noise patterns.

In a non-acoustical example, a team from Intel Research Berkeley and MIT created a sensor network deployed and managed by non-technical end users. In their 2004 paper , they describe the design, evaluation and lessons learned from a real-world deployment of 23 nodes in the canopy of a single tree for a period of 20 days. Their battery powered sensor nodes monitor environmental parameters such as light, temperature, humidity and air pressure. Their team focused on the data yield of the network with a particular emphasis on the network routing analysis and its subsequent power consumption. This short term deployment resulted in node level data yields ranging from 22% to 75% with an active node duty cycle of 6.6% with data sampled from the environment every 30s. The authors suggest that the likely cause of data loss is through network collisions where multiple sensors transmit data simultaneously, overloading the network. They recommend implementing fault tolerance at all stages of a deployed sensor network and ensuring that testing is performed at scale to anticipate a wider gamut of failures. Of note is their call for detailed monitoring of sensor networks to better understand failures and the state of individual sensors around the occurrence of these.

An extreme example of remote sensing of active volcanoes in , highlights some of the challenges in building robust and reliable sensor networks where maintenance is extremely difficult. In this example, 13, $3000 USD each, battery powered sensing stations were air-dropped into and around the crater of Mount St. Helens, connected via a low frequency mesh network for multi-hop data transmission and node control. These sensors were tasked with monitoring and transmitting the seismic and ash plume activity of the volcano in real-time, and were studied over a 6 week period. Throughout this period, the data yield or uptime of the network ranged between 34 to 93.6%. The team mainly observed issues with software faults and connectivity either due to lightning strikes on their radio antennas or diurnal fluctuations in signal propagation strength. To combat these, a combination of hardware additions and multiple levels of system monitoring with automatic recovery from software faults was employed. Despite the extreme nature and difference in application of this deployment, many commonalities are observed across these examples of remote sensor networks. 

The Array of Things Project is an ambitions effort to create a large sensor network covering Chicago that is capable of sensing a large variety of physical data points. The project utilizes an alternative high availability infrastructure, Waggle . Our infrastructure is designed to have as little custom code as possible, making heavy use of existing open source projects. Waggle, while it still makes use of some off the shelf products, utilizes many custom software components. Our design chooses aloud us to quickly set up a reliable backed and enabled us to obtain the long term reliability data that we present here.

The sensor network deployments in the reviewed literature are typically short in duration and very localized to a particular area. Their obvious validity aside, none have reported on longitudinal deployments across very large geographical areas, something that is scarcely reported in the literature. Long term sensor network deployments bring with them a multitude of complications that must be overcome to ensure a successful data yield. The following sections will detail the architecture of our resilient sensor network.
